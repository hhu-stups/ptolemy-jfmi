# JFMI - Java Functional Mockup Library

This library is used in ProB 2.0 to perform co-simulation with FMUs. 

The library is based on the JFMI library from the Ptolemy Project (http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/jfmi/index.htm). 

We adapted the code to our needs and changed the code organization.
